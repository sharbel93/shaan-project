         Remember that the messages object is a FirebaseListObservable. 
         This means it will asynchronously stay current with the db. 
         Any changes to the messages in the database will immediately be reflected here. We have to have to specify this relationship in the loop by adding async. -->

           In the CSS I have classes called you and me.
            Which puts the correct css for the chat bubble depending on if it was the active users or not. 
            Using the syntax [class.you]="isYou(message.email)" binds the presence of the class you to the truthfulness of the function isYou. 
            To make both isYou and isMe work we need to add those functions to home-page.component.ts. 
            They return true or false if the email on the message posted matches the email of the current user. -->

             We also want the user to be able to submit their message by hitting enter, so we add the event keyup.enter to trigger our sendMessage function. 
             We also bind the click event on the SEND button to trigger the sendMessage function also. -->
